        Switzerland has a strong and highly developed economy. Its nominal GDP is around USD 900–950 billion, which places it among the top 20 largest economies in the world. Economic growth is usually stable but moderate, averaging around 1–2% per year, reflecting a mature and well-managed economy.GDP per Capita<br>
      Switzerland is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita. The nominal GDP per capita is roughly USD 100,000–105,000, meaning the average economic output per person is extremely high. When adjusted for purchasing power (PPP), GDP per capita is around USD 85,000–95,000, still among the highest globally.</p></td>

The country mainly exports high-value products such as pharmaceuticals and chemicals, machinery, medical technology, precision instruments, and luxury watches, as well as financial and business services. The European Union is Switzerland&rsquo;s most important trading partner, especially Germany, although the United States and China are also key markets, and Switzerland&rsquo;s strong focus on quality, innovation, and specialization allows it to remain competitive despite high production costs.</td>
