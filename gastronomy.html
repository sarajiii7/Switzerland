While world-famous for iconic dishes like Fondue, Raclette, and Rösti, alongside world-renowned Swiss chocolate &amp; cheese, Swiss cuisine is deeply regional, with each canton offering unique specialties rooted in local farming traditions, varying by language region (Italian-style risotto in Ticino, creamy sauces in French-speaking areas). </p></td>
