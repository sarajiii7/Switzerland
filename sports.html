      <td colspan="5">In Switzerland, sport is managed through a decentralized system built on local responsibility, volunteer work, and coordination rather than direct state control. The foundation of the system is the local sports club. Almost every person who practices sport does so through a club in their town or region. These clubs are usually non-profit associations, open to the public, and affordable. They are run mainly by volunteers—parents, former athletes, or community members—who handle administration, coaching, and event organization. Because clubs are rooted in municipalities, access to sport is widespread, even in small villages.</td>

      <td colspan="2"><h2>Alpine Skiing🎿</h2>
        <p>Is an individual winter sport that involves descending snow-covered slopes using skis, with different disciplines such as downhill, slalom, and giant slalom. It is considered Switzerland&rsquo;s national winter sport and is closely linked to the country&rsquo;s mountainous landscape and alpine traditions. About 35 % of Swiss residents ski regularly, which places Switzerland among the countries with the highest skiing participation rates in Europe. Skiing is not only a competitive sport but also a major recreational activity, and when broader leisure surveys are taken into account, downhill skiing appears among the most practiced sports, with participation estimated at around 35.4 %.</p>
      <p>Is Switzerland&rsquo;s national winter sport and is strongly tied to the country&rsquo;s alpine culture and identity.

      <td colspan="5"><p data-start="632" data-end="1131">Above the clubs are the national sports federations. Each sport has its own federation, such as football, ice hockey, athletics, or skiing. These federations do not own or manage the clubs directly. Instead, they organize leagues and competitions, set technical rules, train and license coaches and referees, and manage talent identification and national teams. The federations act as coordinators, ensuring that the same standards apply across the country while allowing clubs to remain autonomous.</p>
        <p data-start="1133" data-end="1449">At the top sits Swiss Olympic, which is the umbrella organization for Swiss sport. Swiss Olympic represents Switzerland internationally, coordinates Olympic participation, distributes funding to federations, and sets ethical and governance standards. It plays a strategic role rather than a hands-on operational one.</p>
        <p data-start="1451" data-end="2220">The role of the state is supportive rather than controlling. The federal government, cantons, and municipalities mainly focus on providing infrastructure and financial support. Municipalities typically own and maintain sports facilities such as football fields, gyms, swimming pools, and ice rinks, which clubs can use at low cost. The federal government supports sport development through policies and funding, most notably through the Youth+Sport (J+S) program. This national program subsidizes youth training, pays part of coach education, and financially supports training sessions and sports camps for young people. As a result, children and teenagers can participate in organized sport at a relatively low cost, and coaching quality remains consistent nationwide.</p>
        <p data-start="2222" data-end="2712">Sport is also integrated into the education system. Physical education is mandatory in Swiss schools, ensuring that all children are exposed to sport from an early age. However, schools are not designed to replace clubs. Talented young athletes usually train with clubs outside school hours. For high-level youth athletes, there are sport-friendly or elite sports schools that adapt academic schedules to training and competition needs, allowing athletes to pursue both education and sport.</p>
        <p data-start="2714" data-end="3319">Elite and professional sport follows a progression from grassroots to high performance. Athletes typically start in a local club, move to regional training centers if they show talent, and may eventually join national teams managed by the federations. Professional clubs, especially in football and ice hockey, may operate as companies, but many still retain an association structure. Switzerland does not use a franchise model; instead, promotion and relegation between leagues is standard. Professional sport is funded through sponsorships, ticket sales, broadcasting rights, and limited public support.</p>
      <p data-start="3321" data-end="3945">Overall, Swiss sports management works well because of strong community involvement, a culture of volunteering, reliable public infrastructure, and cooperation between clubs, federations, and government. The system emphasizes participation and long-term development rather than early specialization or commercial pressure. Its main challenges are dependence on volunteers, limited financial resources compared to larger countries, and the difficulty of fully professionalizing some sports. Despite this, the system consistently produces high participation rates and strong international results, especially in winter sports.</p></td>
