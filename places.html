Economic growth is usually stable but moderate, averaging around 1–2% per year, reflecting a mature and well-managed economy.GDP per Capita<br>
      Switzerland is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita. The nominal GDP per capita is roughly USD 100,000–105,000, meaning the average economic output per person is extremely high. When adjusted for purchasing power (PPP), GDP per capita is around USD 85,000–95,000, still among the highest globally.</p></td>
